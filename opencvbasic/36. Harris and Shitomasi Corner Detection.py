
#Feature Detection and Description.
"""
For understanding  this we recall jisaw puzzle game where we combine multiple
small pieces in correct order by identifying its corners , shape and pattern.
On the basis of all these we all detect corners in images with so many approaches,
"""

#method 1

#Harris Corner Detection (Detect the corner)

"""
OpenCV has the function cv2.cornerHarris() for this purpose. Its arguments are :
img - Input image, it should be grayscale and float32 type.
blockSize - It is the size of neighbourhood considered for corner detection
ksize - Aperture parameter of Sobel derivative used.
k - Harris detector free parameter in the equation.

#We will learn about the another corner detector: Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector
#We will see the function: cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack().
#Shi- Tomasi approach is more effective as compared with Harris Corner detection

#In this we limit the number of corners and corners quality.
#It is more user friendly.
